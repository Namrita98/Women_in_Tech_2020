# Women in Tech 2020
This analysis uses the 2020 survey data from StackOverflow to get a glimpse into where women are in the tech world. 
The following conditions were analyzed:
The number of women and men coding before the age of 18
The gender gaps based on ages 
Efficiency of women in coding compared to men
Average professional coding experience between the genders
Educational qualifications of the two genders

### Conclusion and Inference
Gender gap is still very prevelant in technology community.This may be due to women not having exposure to software in the early years. With an abundance of excellent learning resources via the internet, we expect a decline in the gender gap in the upcoming years.
